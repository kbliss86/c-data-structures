# Lab: Data Structures - String Reversal Using Stacks

## Objective:
- Learn to use data structures like **Stacks** to solve string processing problems.

## Task:
Write a program that takes a word from the user and reverses the input using a stack.

## What the Application Will Do:
1. The application will prompt the user to input a word.
2. The program will reverse the word using a **Stack** data structure.
3. The reversed word will be displayed on the console.

## Build Specifications:
- **Request and take user input** (1 point)
- **Create a separate method for reversing the string** (3 points):
  - The method should return a `string` and take a `string` as a parameter.
- **Use a Stack to reverse the string** (5 points):
  - Instantiate a Stack: 1 point
  - Store the characters of the string in the Stack: 2 points
  - Retrieve the characters from the Stack in reverse order: 2 points
- **Display the reversed string in the console** (1 point)

## Hints:
- You can solve this problem without using a stack, but the objective is to practice using a **Stack**.
- Try solving the problem without a stack first, and then modify your solution to incorporate a stack.

## Extra Challenges:
- Handle cases where the user inputs a **sentence** instead of a word. 
  - Reverse each word individually while keeping the word order intact.
- **Validate user input** to ensure only letters are allowed (no symbols or numbers).
